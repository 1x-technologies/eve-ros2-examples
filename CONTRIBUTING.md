## Contribution guidelines

To contribute to the code in this repository please follow a standard git workflow, an example of which we include below. You can expect a more formal definition of this workflow as soon as we have more out-of-house contributors to this project.

1. If you have a problem with some already written code, or are unsure about something, create an issue an assign the repository maintainer.
2. After reviewing your issue the maintainer will either fix the problem themselves or will request you to contribute towards a solution.
3. To contribute, checkout a new branch of [suitable name](https://gist.github.com/jefffederman/1d492f98b8e3913a75ca#file-naming-git-branches-md) and develop there.
4. Before opening a pull request, test you code thoroughly via the procedure outlined at the end of the [README](README.md), once all tests are passed you can open a pull request and assign the maintainer as reviewer.
5. Await a response.
